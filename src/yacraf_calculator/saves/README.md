# Saves

Each save, containing its own `Metamodel Views` and `System Views`, are saved in individual directories here. In each directory is a `configuration` and `setup` directory, storing the `Metamodel Views` and `System Views`, respectively. Additionally, found is also a file `view_file_paths.txt` specifying the paths and order of the currently active `Views` in this save. Any deleted `View` is, unless overwritten by another `View` using the same name, will remain in the corresponding folder, allowing for recovery if a save would be accidentally deleted from within the GUI.
