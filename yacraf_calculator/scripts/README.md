# Creating Scripts

To create a new script, create a copy of the `SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.py` file and rename it. When booting the program, a button to run the newly created script will appear in the bottom right corner of the `System Views`. The scripts interface to the program through different methods in a `ScriptInterface` class, each one explained at the top of the script template. Examples of available methods are temporarily overriding values, getting calculated values, setting a GUI marker to visually mark specific class instances, etc.

The default scripts found here should mainly be seen as examples of how to use the functionality. Specifically, some of them are not fully finalized, and their general correctness cannot be guaranteed.
